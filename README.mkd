# ooc-mhash
## A mhash binding for ooc

ooc-mhash gives ooc programs access to a host of hash algorithms, which can be used to compute checksums, message digests, and other signatures. 

This is a partial binding. You won't be able to use Mhash's Keygen and HMAC features yet.

Here's an example of how you could use ooc-mhash:

    import mhash/Mhash

    m := Mhash new(Algo SHA1)
    m feed("Hello")
    m feed(" ")
    m feed("World!")

    "%s sez hi!" format(m hexdigest()) println()
